    """Transposes a 3D array from shape (N,N,nt) to (nt,N,N),

    where N is the number of nodes in a network (features) and nt is the
    number of time-points (samples).

    Parameters
    ----------
    tensor : ndarray of rank-3.
        Temporal evolution of the N x N elements in a matrix, arranged with
        shape (N,N,nt).

    Returns
    -------
    newtensor : ndarray of rank-3.
        Same as input 'tensor' but in shape (nt,N,N). Matrix rows an columns at
        each slice in 'tensor' are conserved row and columns in 'newtensor'.

    -----
    Please remind that np.transpose() function returns a view of the array,
    not a copy! If you want a copy with the entries properly sorted in memory,
    call the function as follows:
