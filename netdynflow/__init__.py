Network Analysis Based on Perturbation-Induced Flows
====================================================

A package to study complex networks based on the spatio-temporal propagation of
flows due to external perturbations.
Compatible with Python 3.X.

- 'Dynamic Flow' characterises the transient network response over time, as the
network dynamics relax towards their resting-state after a pulse perturbation
(either independent or correlated Gaussian noise) has been applied to selected
nodes.

NetDynFlow treats networks as connectivity matrices, represented as 2D NumPy
arrays. Given (i) a connectivity matrix and (ii) a an input covariance matrix,
conditional pair-wise network flows return a set of matrices (a 3D NumPy array),
each describing the state of the state of the pairwise node interations at
at consecutive time points.

Available functions
*******************

The package is organised into two modules:

core.py
    Functions to calculate spatio-temporal evolution of conditiona network flows.
metrics.py
    Descriptors to analyse the spatio-temporal evolution of perturbation-induced
    flows in a network.

To see the list of all functions available use the standard help in an
interactive session, for both modules ::

>>> import netdynflow as ndf
>>> ndf.core?
>>> ndf.metrics?

    **NOTE:**
    Importing NetDynflow brings all functions in the two modules into its
    local namespace. Thus, functions in each of the two modules are called as
    `ndf.func()` instead of `ndf.core.func()` or `ndf.metrics.func()`. Details
    of each function is also found using the usual help, e.g.,

	>>> ndf.DynFlow?
	>>> ndf.Diversity?

In an IPython interactive session, or in a Jupyter Notebook, typing ``netdynflow``
and then pressing <tab> will show all the modules and functions available in
the package.

Using NetDynFlow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Since NetDynFlow depends on NumPy, it is recommended to import NumPy first,
although this is not necessary for loading the package: ::

>>> import numpy as np
>>> import netdynflow as ndf

    **Note**:
    Importing netdynflow imports also all functions in module *core.py*
    into its namespace. Module *metrics.py* is imported separately. Therefore,
    if the import is relative those functions can be called as, e.g.,  ::

    >>> import netdynflow as ndf
    >>> ...
    >>> sigma = np.identity(N)
    >>> dynflow = ndf.DynFlow(net, tau, sigma)

We did not have to call ``netdynflow.core.DynFlow()``. In the case of an absolute
import (using an asterisk ``*``) all functions in *core.py* are imported to the
base namespace:  ::

    >>> from netdynflow import *
    >>> ...
    >>> sigma = np.identity(N)
    >>> dynflow = DynFlow(net, tau, sigma)

Getting started
***************
Create a simple weighted network of N = 4 nodes (a numpy array) and compute its
dynamic flow over time: ::

>>> net = np.array(((0, 1.2, 0, 0),
                    (0, 0, 1.1, 0),
                    (0, 0, 0, 0.7),
                    (1.0, 0, 0, 0)), float)

>>> tau = 0.8
>>> sigma = np.identity(N)  # Matrix of initial perturbations
>>> dynflow = ndf.DynFlow(net, tau, sigma, tmax=15, timestep=0.01)

The resulting variable ``dynflow`` is an array of rank-3 with dimensions
(nt,N,N) where nt = (tmax / tstep) containing nt = 1500 matrices of size 4 x 4,
each describing the pair-wise flows in the network over time.

    **NOTE**:
    NetDynFlow employs the convention in graph theory that rows of the
    connectivity matrix encode the outputs of the node. That is, `net[i,j] = 1`
    implies that the node in row ``i`` projects over the node in column ``j``.

Now we calculate the *total flow* and the ``diversity`` of the network over
time as:  ::

>>> totalflow = ndf.TotalEvolution(dynflow)
>>> divers = ndf.Diversity(dynflow)

``totalflow`` and ``divers`` are two arrays of length (tmax / tsteps) = 1500.
