    The time need for pair-wise, nodes or networks flows to decay.

    Strictly speaking, this function measures the time that the cumulative

    For example, 'fraction = 0.99' means the time needed to reach 99%

    """
    Total amount of flow across time for pair-wise, node or whole-network.

    The function calculates the area-under-the-curve for the flow curves over

    the whole network, depending on the input array given.
    - If 'arr' is a (nt,N,N) flow tensor, the output 'totalflow' will be an

        If timespan = 'raise', the function calculates the area-under-the-
        curve from t0 = 0, to the time the flow(s) reach a peak value.
