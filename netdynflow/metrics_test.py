    # At least, it is never slower
    """
    Randomises a (weighted) connectivity matrix.
    The function returns a random connectivity matrix with the same number of
    links as the input matrix. The resulting connectivity has the same link
    weights of the input matrix (thus total weight is also conserved) but the
    input / output strengths of the nodes are not conserved. If 'con' is an
    unweighted adjacency matrix, the function returns an Erdos-Renyi-like
    random graph, of same size and number of links as 'con'.
    If the binarisation of 'con' is a symmetric matrix, the result will also be
    symmetric. Otherwise, if 'con' represents a directed network, the result
    will be directed.
    !!!!!!!
    GORKA: In the current version, if the underlying graph is undirected but the
    weights are asymmetric, the function won't work. The result will be a
    symmetric matrix and the total weight will likely not be conserved !!!

    Randomises a (weighted) connectivity matrix.

    The function returns a random connectivity matrix with the same number of
    links as the input matrix.
    ACHTUNG!!! However, the weights are always randomised such
    that they are asymmetric. Therefore, if 'con' is symmetric weighted matrix,
    the function returns an undirected underlying graph, but with the weights
    asymmetric. So, I don't like it.
