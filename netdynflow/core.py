Calculation of dynamic communicability and flow
===============================================

This module contains functions to calculate the temporal evolution of the
pair-wise, conditional flows in a network due to perturbations. The location
and intensity of the initial perturbation can be defined by the users.
Networks are treated as connectivity matrices, represented as 2D NumPy arrays.
Given a connectivity matrix, the subsequent flows are returned as a series of
matrices arranged into a tensor (a numpy array of rank-3), each describing the
state of the network at consecutive time points.

Helper functions
----------------
TransitionMatrix
    Returns the transition probability matrix for random walks.
JacobianMOU
    Calculates the Jacobian matrix for the MOU dynamic system.

Generation of main tensors
--------------------------

    Computes the pair-wise responses over time for the discrete cascade model.
RespMatrices_RandomWalk
    Computes the pair-wise responses over time for the simple random walk model.

    where tau is a leakage time-constant for a dissipation of the flows through

    process, when additive Gaussian white noise is included.
    Given Î»max is the largest eigenvalue of the (positive definite) matrix A, then
    - if tau < tau_max = 1 / Î»max, then the leakage term dominates in the long
    time and the solutions for all nodes converge to zero.
