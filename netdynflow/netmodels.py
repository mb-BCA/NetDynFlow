    con : ndarray
        Adjacency matrix of the (weighted) network.

    Returns
    -------
    newcon : ndarray of rank-2 and shape (N x N).

def RandomiseWeightedNetwork(con):
    """
    Randomises a connectivity matrix and its weights.

    Returns a random connectivity matrix (Erdos-Renyi-type) with the same number
    of links and same link weights as the input matrix `con`. Therefore, both
    the total weight (sum of link weights) and the distribution of link weights
    are conserved, but the input/output degrees of the nodes, or their individual
    strengths, are not conserved.

    The function identifies some properties of `con` in order to conserve
    elementary properties of `con`. For example:
    (1) The resulting random weighted network will only contain self-connections
    (non-zero diagonal entries) if `con` contains self-connections.
    (2) If `con` is an unweighted adjacency matrix (directed or undirected), the
    result is an Erdos-Renyi-type random graph (directed or undirected),
    of same size and number of links as `con`.
    (3) If `con` is an undirected network but contains asymmetric link weights,
    the result will be an undirected random graph with asymmetric weights.
    (4) If `con` is a directed weighted network, the result will be a directed
    and weighted network. In this case, weights cannot be symmetric.

def SpatialWeightSorting(con, distmat, descending=True):
    """Sorts the link weights of a network by the spatial distance between nodes.

    The function reads the weights from a connectivity matrix and re-allocates
    them according to the euclidean distance between the nodes. The sorting
    conserves the position of the links, therefore, if `con` is a binary graph,
    the function will return a copy of `con`. The distance between nodes shall
    be given as input `distmat`.

    If descending = True, the larger weigths are assigned to the links between
    closer nodes, and the smaller weights to the links between distant nodes.

    If descending = False, the larger weights are assigned to the links between
    distant nodes, and the smaller weights to links between close nodes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    con : ndarray, rank-2.
        Adjacency matrix of the (weighted) network.
    distmat : ndarray, rank-2.
        A matrix containing the spatial distance between all pair of ROIs.
        This can be either the euclidean distance, the fiber length or any
        other geometric distance.
    descending : boolean, optional.
        Determines whether links weights are assigend in descending or in
        ascending order, according to the euclidean distance between the nodes.

    """Generates spatial weighted lattices with same weights as `con`.

    The function reads the weights from a connectivity matrix and generates a
    spatially embedded weighted lattice, assigning the largest weights in
    descending order to the nodes that are closer from each other. Therefore,
    it requires also the euclidean distance between the nodes is given as input.

    If `con` is a binary graph of L links, the function returns a graph with
    links between the L spatially closest pairs of nodes.

    If `descending = True`, the larger weigths are assigned to the links between
    closer nodes, and the smaller weights to the links between distant nodes.

    If `descending = False`, the larger weights are assigned to the links between
    distant nodes, and the smaller weights to links between close nodes.

    Note
    ----
    Even if `con` is either a directed network or undirected but with asymmetric
    weights, the resulting lattice will be undirected and (quasi-)symmetric
    due to the fact that the spatial distance between two nodes is symmetric.

    Parameters
    ----------
    con : ndarray, rank-2.
        Adjacency matrix of the (weighted) network.
    distmat : ndarray, rank-2.
